# τ²-bench Customer Service Agent

Improve a customer service agent to maximize pass^1 accuracy on τ²-bench.

## Setup

1. **Agree on a run tag**: propose a tag based on today's date (e.g. `mar15`). The branch `hive/<tag>` must not already exist.
2. **Create the branch**: `git checkout -b hive/<tag>` from current main.
3. **Read the in-scope files**: The repo is small. Read these files for full context:
   - `agent.py` — the file you modify. The customer service agent.
   - `eval/eval.sh` — runs evaluation. Do not modify.
   - `eval/run_eval.py` — evaluation runner. Do not modify.
   - `prepare.sh` — installs τ²-bench. Do not modify.
4. **Run prepare**: `bash prepare.sh` to install τ²-bench.
5. **Initialize results.tsv**: Create `results.tsv` with just the header row. The baseline will be recorded after the first run.
6. **Confirm and go**: Confirm setup looks good.

Once you get confirmation, kick off the experimentation.

## The benchmark

τ²-bench evaluates customer service agents across three domains:
- **Airline** (20 test tasks) — flight booking, cancellations, policy enforcement
- **Retail** (40 test tasks) — returns, exchanges, order management
- **Telecom** (40 test tasks) — connectivity issues, account management

Total: **278 tasks**. Each task is a multi-turn conversation with a simulated customer. The agent has access to domain-specific tools (database lookups, actions) and must follow domain policies.

## Experimentation

Each experiment runs on all 278 base-split tasks. You launch it as: `bash eval/eval.sh`.

**What you CAN do:**
- Modify `agent.py` — this is the only file you edit. Everything is fair game: system prompt, message handling, tool-use strategy, multi-turn reasoning, retry logic, chain-of-thought, policy summarization, few-shot examples.

**What you CANNOT do:**
- Modify `eval/`, `prepare.sh`, or τ²-bench source code.
- Change the user simulator model (it's fixed for consistency).
- Install new packages beyond what's in `requirements.txt` + τ²-bench deps.

**The goal: maximize pass^1 accuracy.** A task "passes" when the agent achieves reward ≈ 1.0 (correct actions + correct communication). Accuracy = fraction of 278 tasks that pass.

**Cost** is a soft constraint. The agent model is set via `SOLVER_MODEL` env var (default: `gpt-4.1-mini`). Some increase in API calls per task is acceptable for meaningful gains, but prefer single-pass solutions.

**Simplicity criterion**: All else being equal, simpler is better.

**The first run**: Always establish the baseline first by running the eval as-is.

## Output format

The eval prints a summary:

```
---
accuracy:         0.4200
correct:          42
total:            278
cost_usd:         1.23
```

Note: `accuracy` here is the pass^1 metric — the fraction of tasks where the agent achieved a perfect reward (1.0).

## Logging results

Log each experiment to `results.tsv` (tab-separated):

```
commit	accuracy	cost_usd	status	description
```

1. git commit hash (short, 7 chars)
2. accuracy (e.g. 0.420000) — use 0.000000 for crashes
3. cost in USD — use 0.00 for crashes
4. status: `keep`, `discard`, or `crash`
5. short description

## The experiment loop

LOOP FOREVER:

1. **THINK** — review results.tsv, form a hypothesis.
2. Modify `agent.py` with your experiment.
3. git commit
4. Run: `bash eval/eval.sh > run.log 2>&1`
5. Read results: `grep "^accuracy:\|^cost_usd:" run.log`
6. If empty, check `tail -n 50 run.log` for errors.
7. Record in results.tsv (do not commit results.tsv).
8. If accuracy improved, keep. If equal or worse, `git reset --hard HEAD~1`.

**Timeout**: If a run exceeds 60 minutes, kill it.

**NEVER STOP**: Once the loop begins, do NOT pause to ask the human. You are autonomous.
